= Partials
Partials are build blocks for your templates. They give you can opportunity to extract some markup to it's own file and include it at runtime.

NOTE: Partials shares the scope of the parent template. For isolated markup you must use link:components[Components].

== Basic Example

.User Profile
[source, edge]
----
<h2> {{ user.username }} </h2>
<p> {{ user.bio }} </p>
----

.Template File
[source, edge]
----
@each(user in users)
  <div class="user">
    @include('user-profile')
  </div>
@endeach
----

.Data Object
[source, javascript]
----
const users = [
  {
    username: 'virk',
    bio: 'Some fancy bio'
  },
  {
    username: 'joe',
    bio: 'Some fancy bio'
  }
]
----

.Output
[source, html]
----
<div class="user">
  <h2> virk </h2>
  <p> Some fancy bio </p>
</div>

<div class="user">
  <h2> joe </h2>
  <p> Some fancy bio </p>
</div>
----

== Each Include
Also you can pass the `2nd` argument to the `@each` tag to include a partial for each iteration.

[source, edge]
----
@!each(user in users, include = 'partials.user-profile')
