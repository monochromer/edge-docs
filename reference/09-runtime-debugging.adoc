= RunTime Debugging
Unlike other templating engines, Edge does a fantastic job in letting you debug your views at runtime using Chrome devtools.

Since your views are compiled to a javascript function, Edge makes sure the compiled template is readable and thus easier to debug.

== Basic Example
In order to debug your template, you can make use of `@debugger` keyword. Make sure `@debugger` is the only statement on a given line.

.Invalid
[source, edge]
----
@debugger and some content
----

.Valid
[source, edge]
----
@debugger
and some content
