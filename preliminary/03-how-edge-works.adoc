= How Edge Works?

This is the deep dive guide on Edge. It is fine, if you want to skip this guide and just use edge in your application. Otherwise follow along to explore the interesting territory of Edge.

Rendering a template is divided into 2 different steps called *Compile time* and *Runtime*. All templates are compiled only once and then fetched from in-memory cache. For development you can turn off the caching so that they are compiled everytime you make a new change.

== Compiler
Let's understand how underlying compiler works in Edge. The process is again divided into 2 different steps of *generating the AST* and *converting the values into expressions*. Let's take a small example on how the `@if` tag will be compiled.

.Template File
[source, edge]
----
@if(username === 'virk')
    <h2> Hello {{ username }} </h2>
@endif
----

=== AST
The above template will be processed via `Ast` class, which generates a nested tree by parsing each line at a time.

NOTE: There are more properties on each node of AST. I have removed them, so that the example output is readable

.Ast of above template
[source, js]
----
[
  {
    tag: 'if',
    args: 'username',
    lineno: 1,
    body: `@if(username === 'virk')`
    childs: [
      {
        tag: null,
        args: null,
        lineno: 2,
        body: 'Hello {{ username }}'
      }
    ]
  }
]
----

The AST class understands how *tags* works in Edge. So it smartly parses them and nest the content inside the tag body as childs. This is a recursive operation, which means you can have nested tags inside your templates.

Also, it will keep a track of open tags and if you don't close a *block level tag*, the compiler will throw an exception.

=== Processing Nodes
Once the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) has been generated, each node of the tree will be processed in sequence.

1. When node is a `tag`, compiler will call the `compile` method of the registered tag and it is the responsibility of the tag to *understand*, *validate* the *process* the code.
2. Otherwise the line will be *interpolated* to process the content inside `{{ }}`.

Each tag gets the `lexer` object, which can be used to convert any statement into a Javascript expression. Also tags can tell the lexer to only allow certain expressions. Let's continue with the `if` tag example.

[source, js]
----
class IfTag {

  compile (compiler, lexer, buffer, { body, childs, lineno }) {
    // here body => username === 'virk'
    const expression = lexer.parseRaw(body)
    console.log(expression.tokens) <1>
  }

}
----
<1> Following is the output of the `console.log` statement.

[source, js]
----
{
  type: 'binary',
  lhs: {
    value: 'username',
    type: 'source'
  },
  rhs: {
    value: 'virk',
    type: 'string'
  },
  operator: '==='
}
----

Above generated information is enough to know the structure of the code and compile it to a valid Javascript statement. The *ifTag* converts these tokens into.

[source, js]
----
if (this.context.resolve('username') === 'virk') {

}
----

1. `this.context.resolve` is a function available to the template in runtime and is used to fetch the value of a variable from the `data` object.
2. Since the `rhs` is a normal string, we can keep it as it is.

NOTE: Above is just an example of how `lexer` can be used to generate expression tokens and compile them into valid Javascript. There are so many moving parts to this. Make sure to check the actual source code of link:https://github.com/poppinss/edge/blob/develop/src/Lexer/index.js[lexer] and link:https://github.com/poppinss/edge/blob/develop/src/Tags[tags]. Also there is a comprehensive link:https://github.com/poppinss/edge/tree/develop/test/unit[test suite] for each part of the code.

=== Compiler Flow Chart
Below is the flow chart of the compiler.

== RunTime
Once template has been compiled successfully, Edge will run the template by calling the compiled output as a function. The function `scope (this)` is bound to the *Template class* and has access to the following object.

1. `this` will be the instance of link:https://github.com/poppinss/edge/blob/develop/src/Template/index.js[Template Class].
2. `this.context` will be the instance of link:https://github.com/poppinss/edge/blob/develop/src/Context/index.js[Context Class].

You cannot directly access these classes inside `.edge` files, since compiler will turn them into something else. For example:

.edge file
[source, edge]
----
{{ this.context.resolve('username') }}
----

Will be converted into

[source, js]
----
this.callFn(this.accessChild(this.resolve('this'), ['context', 'resolve']), ['username'])
----

Once Edge will run the above template, something *bad will happen* for sure, since the meaning of the template has changed into a very complex statement.

NOTE: `this` or `this.context` should be used when you are trying to extend the core by adding your own tags. Not when you are defining templates.

== Context
As you would have noticed, the `Context` class is used quite a lot to run templates. Context is basically a store which has everything your template will need at runtime. For example: It has access to *globals*, *data object*, *presenter*, etc.

The most important piece of code is to know how the `context.resolve` method works. It will try to resolve a variable by looking at following places, prefrence given from top to bottom.

1. Presenter class.
2. Data/Locals object.
3. Finally, it will fallback to globals.

== Edge Vocabulary
You will hear the following terms quite often when working with Edge templates or reading documentation. Let's understand these terms and their meaning.

|====
| Term | Description
| Tags | Tags are functions that starts with `@`. For example: `@if` or `@include`. Tags are the backbone of Edge, since they make your templates dynamic. You can also add your own tags.
| Globals | Globals are `key/value` pairs that exists on each template at runtime. It is nice to create globals for shared functionality
| Locals | Locals are values that you can pass to a template before running it. Locals can be useful for passing the *HTTP request data* to your views.
| Presenter | Presenter is a Javascript class attached to a given view, so that you can keep complex logic inside a Javascript file instead of keeping it inside `.edge` file.
